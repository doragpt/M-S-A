Sure, I can help you verify the data flow for the specified API endpoints to ensure data is being stored correctly. I'll take a look at the API functions related to each of these endpoints and check that they include the necessary logic for data insertion or updates.

/api/history/optimized: This endpoint in api_endpoints.py handles the data retrieval for store history. The data is fetched from the store_status table, but there's no data insertion happening here. Make sure the scraping or data entry processes correctly populate the store_status table used by this endpoint.

/api/stats/area: This endpoint calculates statistics based on the latest store status data. It uses store_status data in queries to group and average operation rates by area. Like the history endpoint, the precision of stored data in store_status is crucial.

/api/ranking/genre: This endpoint returns a genre ranking using a similar approach to /api/stats/area, aggregating data from store_status. It relies on data being up-to-date and correctly categorized by genre.

/api/ranking/popular: Popular ranking is determined from averaged operation rates over a specified period. The accuracy depends on historical records stored in store_status, evaluated over time intervals.

For all endpoints:

Ensure your data collection method, such as scrape_store_data(), writes correct entries to the store_status table within the models.py defined scheme.
Confirm that the scheduled_scrape() function properly updates or inserts new records into the database as it runs.
Use proper error handling to capture and resolve exceptions during data writes, ensuring the database connection and queries are robust and effective.
If you experience any persistent issues with incorrect or missing data, directly check the scraper logic or detailed execution traces during data ingestion into store_status. Feel free to reach out if you need further assistance with specific functionality or require additional code inspections.
